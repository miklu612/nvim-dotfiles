# Neovim dotfiles

These are just my Neovim dotfiles. Posted them here primaraly to store them,
but feel free to use them if you want. Just keep in mind I will update this
according to my own needs and not anyone else's.

## Requirements

I am not sure which version is needed for each, but picking the latest stable
release is the best bet.

- rust analyzer
- clangd (optional)
- lua ls (optional)
- Neovim 0.10.1 or over
